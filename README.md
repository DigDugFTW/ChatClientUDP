# ChatClientUDP

This is a learning project based on the user datagram protocol, and will have a server as well as a client.

The client can connect to the server, where the server owner can manage clients and do server owner stuff.

The server will be able to handle as many clients as he/she wants and will have a few security measures (in the future)
such as password protection / encryption etc.

This chat client is primarily as of now, targeted towards text chat; however that is not to say that some time in the future it 
may not upgrade to voip and have the ability to transfer files and other such data to friends.

This project is a work up to a larger project that I have in mind.
